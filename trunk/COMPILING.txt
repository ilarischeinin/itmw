Compiling iTuneMyWalkman

1. To compile iTuneMyWalkman you need to have the following (or later) versions:
Mac OS X 10.4, iTunes 7, iPhoto 6

2. Because the iTunes scripts contain tell application "iTuneMyWalkman" blocks,
compiling fails if it cannot find the iTuneMyWalkman application. So, you may
need to download the built application separately in order to be able to compile.
